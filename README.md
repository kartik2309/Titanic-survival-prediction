# Titanic-survival-prediction
Predicts if a passenger survived in Titanic accident using machine learning techniques

eda_n.py: Exploratory Data Analyis(EDA). In this file, I have analysed the data and selected important independent variables for classifcation.

data_cleaning.py: A file, that helps in cleaning of the data. Selecting features, performing some important data tranformations, as observed during EDA.

ml_model.py: Here we create an ensemble machine learning model of Support Vector Classifier, Gradient Boost Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Multi Layered Perceptron Classifier and Bagging Classifier, and get the final prediction by taking the mode of the predictions made by all of them. We Also train our model here.
